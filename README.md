# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Balancing between all the Course Inductions and the Freshers' Week events was quite a task, yet I believe that it represented a 
great introduction to what will be expected from me time-management wise. The Robot Olympiad was an interesting "ice-breaker"
experience and I was able to get acquainted with most of my coursemates. Furthermore, I got my first taste of what working
in a team is like and I've realized just how little I know about working in a team.

## Week 1

Given my prior programming experience, Python was not particularly diffcilut to pick up. However, the features of PyGame 
took quite some time to get accustomed to. I cannot seem to grasp the concepts of Surfaces just yet, but as the old saying goes, 
practice makes perfect. For now, I do believe my focus should be on understanding the 
basis of PyGame.

## Week 2

I was able to gain a new understanding of the PyGame Surfaces. Seeing them as 2D arrays
helped me in creating image-manipulating programs. Consequently, it dawned upon me
that certain familiar concepts can be applied and abstracized in order to develop
and understand more complex notions. Additionally, I was introduced to the Agile 
Philosophy and some of its key features. I do believe more insight will be needed
if I am to fully comprehend the Agile Development Practices, given that I am quite
unfamiliar with team-oriented work and practices. Therefore, I decided to started reading
a book titled "Clean Code".

## Week 3

So far, I find my current assignments quite enjoyable, since the concepts are similar to what I've been learning in college. I was also able to make some progress on my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, but I'm still struggling with the logic of Pygame and how it treats images. I was told using 2D arrays is the way to go for the assignment, but I need some time to remember some of the techniques I used to know for array transformation.
The Game Concept went pretty well, although I fear I may have stuttered quite a bit and I may have not communicated all the ideas that I had for the game in the most efficient manner possible. As for Version Control, I am entirely baffled by Github, as I have no prior experience in using it. I believe watching some of the videos provided will come in handy, especially since we'll be using GitHub quite soon.

## Week 4

I am finally ready to start work on our game project! I'm still thrilled that my idea was so well received during the presentation, and now that I will see it come to fruition, I just can't wait to get to work! My fellow team members are Jakob, Cyrus and Adrian, they seem like nice people and I'm glad I will be working with them. We will have to start by using RealTimeBoards, as recommended by our tutors, as well as Trello. I have also gained some insight into how our Essays will have to be written. We also had our first PO meeting, we will have to provide more information in our further meetings. I have decided to work with my team mates on our Trello Board and Real Time Board to provide some more useful information and to lay down some basic ideas and concepts for our game.

## Week 5

This week we had our review for the Agile proposal. Even though I found it quite hard, I was able to find a mostly suitable topic - "What are the challenges of transitioning to Agile for large teams?". I have some concerns that it may be a bit too broad of a topic, given how large the scope of the Agile Philosophy is, but right now I lack the knowledge to select something more specific. Therefore, I will be reading "Clean Code", which just arrived a few days ago, and see if I can get a better understanding. I was also able to get some basic images loaded in our Pygame project, which is a start, but I will have to look into it a bit more. As for the Tinkering Graphics Contract, we were all able to finish, and I am quite satisfied with the end result.

## Week 6

 According to our tutors, the use of "mapped" values would have been prefferable for my random item generator, will have to look more into it and see how I can go about doing that. As for the rest of the week, we had studio practice every day (lucky us!). We had daily Scrum meetings and managed to get a mostly-woring prototype done by the Demo session on Friday. Ironically, after we got our feedback, me and Cyrus sat down and worked on refactoring the entire codebase and we were able to make incredible progress, all in just one afternoon!

## Week 7

I was quite nervous regarding the Agile Essay. I am quite confident in my writing skills, but I believe that I need to put more effort into studying the ins and outs of the Agile Philosophy. Luckily, the assignment showed me that there are quite a few places I have to work in (time management, mostly). I didn't start working on the assignment too late or anything, I just think that I should have separated my workload over the course of more weeks.
