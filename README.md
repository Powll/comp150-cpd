# COMP150 - Reflective Journal to Accompany My CPD Report

You should reflect across the first 13 weeks of the course. This is the period from induction week to the Winter vacation. In your reflections, you should try to identify at least one challenge that you experienced and/or obstacle that you encountered that week. Consider which skills and/or characteristics that challenge/obstacle relates to. 

This will prove to be a considerable aid when you need to identify the most important areas of personal development in your report. Do try to keep up by completing an entry in the journal every week.

## Week 0

Balancing between all the Course Inductions and the Freshers' Week events was quite a task, yet I believe that it represented a 
great introduction to what will be expected from me time-management wise. The Robot Olympiad was an interesting "ice-breaker"
experience and I was able to get acquainted with most of my coursemates. Furthermore, I got my first taste of what working
in a team is like and I've realized just how little I know about working in a team.

## Week 1

Given my prior programming experience, Python was not particularly diffcilut to pick up. However, the features of PyGame 
took quite some time to get accustomed to. I cannot seem to grasp the concepts of Surfaces just yet, but as the old saying goes, 
practice makes perfect. For now, I do believe my focus should be on understanding the 
basis of PyGame.

## Week 2

I was able to gain a new understanding of the PyGame Surfaces. Seeing them as 2D arrays
helped me in creating image-manipulating programs. Consequently, it dawned upon me
that certain familiar concepts can be applied and abstracized in order to develop
and understand more complex notions. Additionally, I was introduced to the Agile 
Philosophy and some of its key features. I do believe more insight will be needed
if I am to fully comprehend the Agile Development Practices, given that I am quite
unfamiliar with team-oriented work and practices. Therefore, I decided to started reading
a book titled "Clean Code".

## Week 3

So far, I find my current assignments quite enjoyable, since the concepts are similar to what I've been learning in college. I was also able to make some progress on my Tinkering Graphics Assignment, but I'm still struggling with the logic of Pygame and how it treats images. I was told using 2D arrays is the way to go for the assignment, but I need some time to remember some of the techniques I used to know for array transformation.
The Game Concept went pretty well, although I fear I may have stuttered quite a bit and I may have not communicated all the ideas that I had for the game in the most efficient manner possible. As for Version Control, I am entirely baffled by Github, as I have no prior experience in using it. I believe watching some of the videos provided will come in handy, especially since we'll be using GitHub quite soon.

## Week 4

I am finally ready to start work on our game project! I'm still thrilled that my idea was so well received during the presentation, and now that I will see it come to fruition, I just can't wait to get to work! My fellow team members are Jakob, Cyrus and Adrian, they seem like nice people and I'm glad I will be working with them. We will have to start by using RealTimeBoards, as recommended by our tutors, as well as Trello. I have also gained some insight into how our Essays will have to be written. We also had our first PO meeting, we will have to provide more information in our further meetings. I have decided to work with my team mates on our Trello Board and Real Time Board to provide some more useful information and to lay down some basic ideas and concepts for our game.

## Week 5

This week we had our review for the Agile proposal. Even though I found it quite hard, I was able to find a mostly suitable topic - "What are the challenges of transitioning to Agile for large teams?". I have some concerns that it may be a bit too broad of a topic, given how large the scope of the Agile Philosophy is, but right now I lack the knowledge to select something more specific. Therefore, I will be reading "Clean Code", which just arrived a few days ago, and see if I can get a better understanding. I was also able to get some basic images loaded in our Pygame project, which is a start, but I will have to look into it a bit more. As for the Tinkering Graphics Contract, we were all able to finish, and I am quite satisfied with the end result.

## Week 6

 According to our tutors, the use of "mapped" values would have been prefferable for my random item generator, will have to look more into it and see how I can go about doing that. As for the rest of the week, we had studio practice every day (lucky us!). We had daily Scrum meetings and managed to get a mostly-woring prototype done by the Demo session on Friday. Ironically, after we got our feedback, me and Cyrus sat down and worked on refactoring the entire codebase and we were able to make incredible progress, all in just one afternoon!

Weekly journal goes here. Reflect.

## Week 7

I was quite nervous regarding the Agile Essay. I am quite confident in my writing skills, but I believe that I need to put more effort into studying the ins and outs of the Agile Philosophy. Luckily, the assignment showed me that there are quite a few places I have to work in (time management, mostly). I didn't start working on the assignment too late or anything, I just think that I should have separated my workload over the course of more weeks. 

## Week 8

The Agile Essay Review went well, I am quite satisfied with the final outcome. However, as I read in my feedback, I probably should have been more careful regarding the little details, such as the usage of images and footnotes. Other than that, I believe that I did quite well. As for Worksheet D, I am very happy with the implementation I came up with (and the fact that I solved it a week ago), but, as our lecturer pointed out, my solution could still be improved upon. I need to learn to spot similar functions that repeat over and over and merge them together for efficiency reason.

## Week 9

This week we had to present our Audio contracts, which were by far ine of the hardest assignments of this study block. I found it quite difficult to grasp the concepts of soundwaves and how they can be added together. Luckily, with my peers help I was able to get some basic code working, as well as some basic functionality for melody creation. I believe I should have spent more time researching music theory and trying to work on the fundamentals. Instead, I spent quite some time getting more ideas implemented in our game: among others, we got the movement system done (mostly), and I believe our inventory system should be done soon. Room progression is also in the making, but I will have to look into how to get that working first. I will watch some tutorials in that regard, hoping I can get some inspiration.

## Week 10

As I suspected, our team struggled with the Audio Contracts and it did show. I, for one, was a bit let down by my own performace, but I think I learned enough from it that I should be able to prevent such an outcome in the foreseeable future. Our Investment Pitches were alright, but I fear we may have focused on the game too much and forgot to actually work on the presentation, and it really showed. I was nervous throughout, stuttered a bit and I fear I may have let the others down. They were able to keep calm and I'm sure they did their best. Regardless, I will take note to not over prioritise certain tasks and forget about other, equally important ones.

## Week 11

We finally got to meet our new teams, and I am honeestly both thrilled and terrifed at the same time. On the one hand, meeting new people and working with different specializaation (arts, design, animation etc.) is sure to be an important step in our journey, but at the same time I am somewhat concerned about how we will interact with each other. Having learned Unity up to this point, and we having no Unreal experience at all, we are all in the same boat, really. Specifically, we have no idea how to begin. We tried to come up with some concepts, but as far as I can tell, we won't be able to agree on anything just yet. On a side note, I am quite sad to see the COMP150 game gone, I had lots of fun working on it and I'm sure we all did our best on it. I am satisfied with our accomplishments and I can only hope that our next project will be even better. We also had our first Unreal workshop, and I am honestly baffled by this engine. I learned C++ for quite some time, but I feel as if I knew nothing. This is, if nothing else, refreshing, as I also feel motivated to try and implement what I know.

## Week 12

Our final week before the holiday, our new team was able to settle on a concept Byron came up with that I strongly encouraged him to put forward as I really see it coming to fruition: Trains, in a Mad max environment - similar to "The Final Station", but in a 3D environment. This is a concept I can really get behind, although I would rather see it as a mobile game, rather than a PC-only game. Futhermore, our assessors for the pitches encouraged us to go for a mobile game, although I am quite stressed about the fact that Unreal doesn't have the best reputation in that regard. As for the team itself, I will try to apply what I learned in my previous project to understand each others strengths' and weaknesses so we can optimally share the workload in the future. Our second Unreal workshop was, well, quieter than the last, but I feel like I am starting to understand a bit of how Unreal treats object properties and how the Blueprint system works. Hopefully, this will help me when I work on the blueprints our designers be using to create the game world.
